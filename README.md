# Currency-Converter
This repository contains a currency converter application built with JavaScript. The application allows users to convert amounts between different currencies using the latest exchange rates fetched from an external API.
It features dynamic country flag updates based on selected currencies and initializes with default currency selections (USD to INR).
The code includes event listeners for user interactions and handles input validation for conversion amount.
